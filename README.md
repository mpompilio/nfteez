# Description
A website that allows users to vote between two NFTs. They are voting to see which one they like better. This will then calculate how many times each NFT has been like, and ignored. Ignored means that it is the NFT that was not chosen out of the two. A Leaderboard page will show all of the NFTs in our system, and rank them based on likes and non-likes. There is a progress bar that allows you to see the percentage of people that choose that NFT when it comes up in their voting. When you click on an NFT from the leaderboard page, you are then brought to a Single NFT page, where you can see comments and also add comments if you are logged in. Comments will appear below the NFT's information.
